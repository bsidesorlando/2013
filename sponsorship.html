<p>
Thank you for your interest in sponsoring Security B-Sides (BSides). Following the success of numerous US and international-based BSides events, we are happy to see continued growth in the community as each year’s events draw bigger crowds and new events are created.
</p><p>
BSides events combine security expertise from a variety of platforms in search of the “next big thing” in information security. BSides is an open platform that gives security experts and industry professionals the opportunity to share ideas, insights, and develop longstanding relationships with others in the community. It is a rare opportunity to directly connect and create trusted relationships with key members of the community.
</p><p>
Although the event itself is free to participants, the cost of hosting such an event is shouldered by the organizers. This package contains sponsorship information for event specific BSides locations in 2013. We have put together different opportunities for sponsorship and their benefits. Of course the greatest benefit is that of giving back to the community and enabling others to grow and learn.
</p><p>
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or requests. You can reach us via email at <a href="mailto:sponsor@bsidesorlando.org">sponsor@bsidesorlando.org</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/BsidesORL">@bsidesorl</a>. Thank you for your consideration.
