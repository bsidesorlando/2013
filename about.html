<h2>BSIDES INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>EVENT INFO</h3>
Security B-Sides is a framework of events that enables individuals to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the confines of traditional media. Frameworks such as BSides enable individuals to drive the event, shape the media, and encourage participation. BSides are free, community organized events put on by local individuals with the expressed goal of enabling a platform for information dissemination. BSides is an ‘unconference’ that follows the ‘open spaces’ format. This varies from structured presentations to smaller break-out groups, but both provide a direct connection between speakers and the audience. The following are several details about the events:
<h3>TIMELINE</h3>

</p>
<h3>GOALS</h3>
<p>
BSides acts as a complement to current events by enabling long-tail spectrum events that complement the current or surrounding event. The goal is to foster communication and collaboration while increasing the level of conversation.
</p><p>
Major conferences focus on the current hot topics in information security. BSides events explore the fringe of conversation and focus on the next big thing. The conversations have ranged from hardware hacking to gender issues, from Twitter hacking to proximity-based identity theft. BSides gives voice to the conversation that is happening just below the surface, and sponsoring enables you to engage that conversation.
</p>
<h3>TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
<p>
While each BSides event is unique, we target the industry professional looking to offset or augment their current security skill set with that of the next-big-thing conversations. These are industry leaders, thought leaders, information security professionals, and even students who wish to expand their body of knowledge. People who attend have various backgrounds in different sectors and verticals. Their common goal is to learn about emerging issues and connect with those who are having them.
</p><p>
Unlike other events where the speaker is rushed in and out, BSides provides a small and intimate environment for the attendees to directly engage the speaker before, during, and after their talk or presentation. Attendees are looking for more than just information; they are looking to make connections they will call upon throughout the rest of the year.
</p><p>
Prior speakers include: Gene Kim, HD Moore, Dino Dai Zovi, Alex Hutton, Tim Keanini, Jonathan Cran, David Mortman, Val Smith, Egyp7, Bruce Potter, Mike Murray, Mike Bailey, Andy Ellis, Jack Daniel, Erin Jacobs, and many more.
</p>
<h2>BSIDES ETHOS</h2>
<h3>FRAMEWORKS</h3>
<p>
Traditional media exist as a constrained system and must operate within the bounds to which it has defined itself. Physical events constrain themselves with space and time, but frameworks permit the continuous creation of individual events. Our goal is to provide people with options by removing those barriers and providing more options of speakers, topics, and events. The initial event in Las Vegas spawned a wave of new events throughout the United States and around the world. Plans are underway for international BSides events in Australia, London, New Delhi, and St. John.
</p>
<h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
<p>
BSides is not made up of members but participants. Each person who participates in BSides brings to it something to contribute. Some people bring hardware, organizational skills, or their friends. You are offering to bring other resources that help fuel the conversation. Sponsoring enables you to engage the conversation and interact with attendees. In return you have our commitment to connect you with those attendees of interest to you and your business. The organizers hope your participation will enable another great BSides event.
</p>
<h3>MEDIA COVERAGE</h3>
<p>
In under a year, BSides has gathered mass media attention and been written up in CSO Online, The Register, ZDNet, and Dark Reading magazines. In addition to the plethora of blog posts and podcasts, BSides has also received coverage from Hacker News Network (HNN), EFFector, and Cisco System Cyber Risk Report.

<h2>SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP</h2>
<h3>THE VALUE OF SPONSORSHIP</h3>
<p>
The goal of BSides is to offer small intimate events where all participants can engage each other to help develop connections and friendships, and network with different industry professionals.
</p><p>
We recognize the value in engaging a smaller audience and being the big fish in a small pond. Every organization will have different goals and priorities. This is why we offer different levels of participation for every individual, group, or organization. We specifically designed several different options for any-sized organization to participate and support this event.
</p>
<h3>REASONS TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>
We recognize your desire to not only support a great event but also to see a return on your investment. The following are a list of direct benefits you may see as an event sponsor.
</p><p>
<strong>BRAND RECOGNITION AND AWARENESS:</strong> Depending on the level of sponsorship, you may recognize your brand placement on some or all of the following: - shirts, signage/lanyards, lunch sessions, or attendee badges. Based on your level of participation, creative and custom branding may be arranged including transportation, banners, and podcast interviews.
</p><p>
<strong>BIG FISH, SMALL POND:</strong> For some, sponsoring large events is not within their price range, leaving them with no option for communicating their message. BSides is just the place for you! This small, community atmosphere brings together active and engaged participants who want to absorb information. Sponsoring a BSides event enables you to be that big fish in a small pond and better communicate your message to an active audience.
</p><p>
<strong>STAY IN TOUCH WITH THE INDUSTRY:</strong> BSides enables its supporters and participants to identify and connect with industry leaders and voices. These participants represent the social networking of security. They are the people who you want to engage to solicit feedback and bring voice to your conversation.
</p><p>
<strong>STAY ABREAST ON THE NEXT BIG THING:</strong> Nobody knows what the “next big thing” will be, but these events are community-driven with presentations voted upon by the industry. There is no magic to how it works, but we believe that listening to the underground can help you prepare and identify what the next big thing might be.
</p><p>
<strong>INTERNET SIMULCAST:</strong> Many of the BSides events are simulcast online meaning your participation can reach a larger audience than just those participants present. At the 2010 San Francisco BSides event, the online audience ranged from 5­-10 times those present onsite at the event. In addition, these simulcasts are archived online for later viewing.
</p><p>
<strong>MEDIA:</strong> The media coverage for BSides is massive compared with its size. Be part of the conversation and get swept up in the media. Many participants have been quoted and picked up by mainstream news sources including National Public Radio (NPR).
</p><p>
<strong>SUPPORT PACKAGES:</strong> Through the distinctive nature of this event, the list of speakers and attendees are available online. We see the benefit in the live interactive engagement of individuals rather than in the cold call connection. Please contact the event organizers for sponsorship and support opportunities.
