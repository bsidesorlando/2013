<h1>April 13, 14 2013. Orlando, Florida</h1>
</nav>

<p>
Security B-sides Orlando is a community driven event seeking to bring together anyone with a passion for making, breaking or protecting. We welcome newbies and experts and anyone in between. Even if you don’t work in information security you will be sure to find topics of interest.
</p><p>
We have chosen dates that complement the established <a href="http://www.misti.com/infosecworld" title="InfoSec World">Infosec World Conference</a> held every spring in Orlando and do not seek to compete with that event. You can come out and see what we have to offer on Saturday and Sunday and then head over to the Walt Disney World Swan & Dolphin to check out the larger conference on Monday. B-Sides Orlando is a smaller event (and free!) that is all about community and the knowledge share.
</p>
<h3>B-sides Orlando will consist of 3 tracks:</h3>
<p>
<strong>Foundations</strong> – This track will cover a variety of topics with a focus on foundational skills every infosec practitioner should know. If you are new to infosec or wanting to make the switch to a security career this is the track for you! This will also be an opportunity for first time speakers to get some exposure as well in a friendly environment.
</p><p>
<strong>Construction</strong> – This track is all about making things and defending them. We hope to have everything from microcontroller sessions and building secure web apps to deploying countermeasures that will sure to ruin the day of any attacker. This is really where the rubber meets the road for most internal security professionals.
</p><p>
<strong>The Wrecking Ball</strong> – Say what you will about the value of pentests, but this is the really fun stuff. Where we bring down that house of cards and show just how tenuously things are put together. This track is all offense, all the time. We have no official stance on disclosure, speakers accept their own risk here but we all geek out pretty hardcore when we see 0-day.
